These includes: a python bundler, opens source paymasters and an open source mobile smart contract wallet.\\\\n\\\\n## Voltaire 4337 Bundler\\\\n\\\\nVoltaire is a modular, developer-friendly and lighting-fast Python Bundler for Ethereum EIP-4337 Account Abstraction. Voltaire is designed to operate within the peer-to-peer mempool of UserOperations, facilitating the inclusion of transactions on-chain more quickly and efficiently.\\\\n\\\\nVoltaire presently has complete coverage of the compatibility test suites written by ERC-4337 team. These test suites ensure that different bundlers can communicate effectively and defend against DDoS attack vectors.\\\\n\\\\nVoltaire is open-source, meaning that anyone can launch Voltaire and start bundling user operations for a service fee. By enabling anyone to participate in the network, the mempool becomes more robust when facing censorship attacks.\\\\n\\\\nA big of part of our inspiration for Voltaire is Trinity, a previous open-source Ethereum client implementation written in Python. We would like to thank the Trinity team, as well as all Python community members for their open-source contributors.\\\\n\\\\n## Candide Wallet\\\\n\\\\nOpen source smart contract mobile wallet - Available on both IOS and Android. Featuring:\\\\n\\\\n- On-Chain Recovery - Forget Seedphrases. Recovering a wallet though designated Recovery Contacts\\\\n\\\\n- Decentralized Focused - Designed to be censorship resistant and free from third party control with ERC-4337\\\\n\\\\n- Dapp with a Single Tap - Leveraging the power of Account Abstraction, bringing bundled calls in standardized way\\\\n\\\\n- Pay Network Fees with Stablecoins - Pay gas fees with supported ERC-20s\\\\n\\\\nFor a bit of background, EIP 4337 is the account abstraction standard for Ethereum & EVM equivalent chains that doesn\\'t compromise on decentralisation and censorship resistance. In practical terms, this means smart contract wallets that don\\'t depend on centralised relayers controlled by a single entity. The role of centralised relayers is replaced with a p2p network of new entities called Bundlers. As the p2p network is still in development, bundlers currently operate as standalone endpoints until they are able to participate in the unified mempool.\\\\n\\\\n## The problem it solves\\\\n\\\\nOur goal is to transition ethereum externally owned accounts (EOAs) to smart contract accounts by contributing to a higher level open infrastructure that doesn\\'t require consensus changes to the protocol.\\\\n\\\\n## Funding plans\\\\n\\\\n- Support Voltaire ERC-4337 to operate in the p2p mempool (libp2p integration)\\\\n- Release a safe open source verifying paymaster implementation in python\\\\n- Release Candide Wallet in a public beta on android\", \"website\": \"https://github.com/candidelabs/\", \"bannerImg\": \"bafkreia7z3c4udrvjhiq44fzguo5dvyolxntzgtjyx5eo4pk6ka25tyny4\", \"logoImg\": \"bafkreibsmvyhubjdjgbivhwu6zdzex46pwmxa6crmxxnw4fjznhr5qa3cy\", \"metaPtr\": {\"protocol\": \"1\", \"pointer\": \"bafkreiahoyjzuy7m2vq7ep345x4ljkxjj7c7dixflngcrt3x756mnwyqdy\"}, \"userGithub\": \"sednaoui\", \"projectGithub\": \"candidelabs\", \"projectTwitter\": \"candidelabs\", \"credentials\": {\"twitter\": {\"@context\": [\"https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1\"], \"type\": [\"VerifiableCredential\"], \"credentialSubject\": {\"id\": \"did:pkh:eip155:1:0x00e6202a8A52a3De6Ce7c45F2e5E299Ec71e875e\", \"hash\": \"v0.0.0:wvK90NVUTBambc+/RaWQlyrQxgrnc36VVwcWPUetDdI=\", \"@context\": [{\"hash\": \"https://schema.org/Text\", \"provider\": \"https://schema.org/Text\"}], \"provider\": \"ClearTextTwitter#candidelabs\"}, \"issuer\": \"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC\", \"issuanceDate\": \"2023-08-11T21:05:05.174Z\", \"proof\": {\"type\": \"Ed25519Signature2018\", \"proofPurpose\": \"assertionMethod\", \"verificationMethod\": \"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC\", \"created\": \"2023-08-11T21:05:05.174Z\", \"jws\": \"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..G6ih05zXZu9CUASdqHWpIhn0wN_XBCKTYtFh395f8tqpmrIU1Wl1Wrlp-xmfWuPLxvcjwFqFquDxpHVHVrKsDw\"}, \"expirationDate\": \"2023-11-09T21:05:05.174Z\"}, \"github\": {\"@context\": [\"https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1\"], \"type\": [\"VerifiableCredential\"], \"credentialSubject\": {\"id\": \"did:pkh:eip155:1:0x00e6202a8A52a3De6Ce7c45F2e5E299Ec71e875e\", \"provider\": \"ClearTextGithubOrg#candidelabs#7014833\", \"@context\": [{\"hash\": \"https://schema.org/Text\", \"provider\": \"https://schema.org/Text\"}], \"hash\": \"v0.0.0:sr3AHlJ7EqHkHnXOJo+u5klFcQtvbLEVn0G/C8mtVog=\"}, \"issuer\": \"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC\", \"issuanceDate\": \"2023-08-11T21:07:01.984Z\", \"proof\": {\"type\": \"Ed25519Signature2018\", \"proofPurpose\": \"assertionMethod\", \"verificationMethod\": \"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC\", \"created\": \"2023-08-11T21:07:01.984Z\", \"jws\": \"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..B_7D0ujwvZtbGIp1mN-Fo-VQ5Ng8ZlOYzQjeIt4lIwbRwqn2niGsV7d9zQ4hF7fYE0-Y4ngVfVdHeSrMbg_yCQ\"}, \"expirationDate\": \"2023-11-09T21:07:01.984Z\"}}}, \"answers\": [{\"questionId\": 0, \"question\": \"Email Address\", \"type\": \"email\", \"hidden\": true, \"encryptedAnswer\": {\"ciphertext\": \"AfE/2DSrXzwBeexymuh2ZqT24HGTftS2Yms9ByjM1ss5ZMSiL1kZ67xrwmKgD8B7\", \"encryptedSymmetricKey\": \"2da2ccd9a6e95468a39fcc6a385c4254fa6e9657c75476971f56786e1b6203e4e372d2fcea4e77188d58fcafea034a07bd439cb18e125c43ba323242fe3772cc618998ec23c813ce8e2a4fcf4d636b9847b1a469c627c32fe04af77b59a32f96718aafbea9552c1db185a1befc0bdb86862ca3d37f6b90667992179c596b4ae00000000000000020c4ef9cb2ff7ef8ba9b7d37ff71424863ca6ebe79935392a789117a6e54677064987e31b5cddb341538faf4dd90b65aaa\"}}, {\"questionId\": 1, \"question\": \"Project GitHub Repo (Not Team Page)\", \"type\": \"link\", \"hidden\": false, \"answer\": \"https://github.com/candidelabs\"}, {\"questionId\": 2, \"question\": \"Telegram Handle (you can answer N/A)\", \"type\": \"short-answer\", \"hidden\": true, \"encryptedAnswer\": {\"ciphertext\": \"sV8i1tf1QJP+uODuxOPl9OkNlzuonAr4Hc1NAY/dVdw=\", \"encryptedSymmetricKey\": \"9944134e3f8f997815136ba4f8179bcad831fa91ac0b1d91cbf32353eded3258715b1abc83118e1439d56f7dc625c7027a4f65b52d8d15bf623bccb3bd9acfe7dc485b5e68f8739f1d37f5eaac6ea8e38ae262eda4179fbe44dd2c0d27dfafb37c1ff22796600fef46cd446ed52b1816eb475d49746489a265bf395e91ccc0da00000000000000204c71e0aa297eda909b816f5fca222db1d824b6efe6f4fc51c2438f97a1336d16a131ce2d836e2961bbc583fb9731b281\"}}, {\"questionId\": 3, \"question\": \"Gitcoin Gov Forum Handle (gov.gitcoin.co)\", \"type\": \"short-answer\", \"hidden\": false}, {\"questionId\": 4, \"question\": \"Link to your Public Group Chat (Discord or Telegram )\", \"type\": \"link\", \"hidden\": false, \"answer\": \"\"}, {\"questionId\": 5, \"question\": \"How is your project in support of or directly advancing the Ethereum Network\\\\u2019s infrastructure?

Dappnode makes it easy to host and run various types of blockchain software, such as Ethereum, Bitcoin, IPFS, and others. The platform also provides users with a user-friendly interface to manage and monitor their nodes.\\\\n\\\\n![dappnode-dashboard](https://bafybeidnqnfyvbsyd3pxhpxxdhharclupqmkrdphyzvgc4mpqnhq2lvx5i.ipfs.w3s.link/dappnode-dashboard-gg.png)\\\\n\\\\nOne of the key benefits of using Dappnode is that it enables users to participate in decentralized networks without needing to rely on centralized infrastructure, such as cloud hosting providers. Users also don\\'t require to have a high technical skillset, since the Dappnode UI makes it easy for users at all levels of technical experience to run their own nodes.\\\\nSolo staking in Dappnode is made simple thanks to the Stakers Menu, which allows you to set up an Ethereum node ready to validate in a few clicks:\\\\n\\\\n![stakersmenu.png](https://bafybeibus3tmm7dtxrbtoo6m7knxrwrmkatiublxpcjxz2cbod4mnrxdiy.ipfs.w3s.link/ethereum-staking-screenshot-d41fdd2a5a44f0e9e7f4094c41ea9e2d.png)\\\\n\\\\nDappnode is an open-source project, which means that anyone can contribute to its development and improvement. The platform is also community-driven, with users collaborating to create and share tools and resources to enhance its functionality.\\\\nDappnode recently launched its Rollups menu, catching up with the needs of its users for privacy as they adapt to scaling solutions in the Ethereum ecosystem. The first implementation was with Optimism, but we\\'ll be expanding to other L2s in the following months. We specially look forward to adapting these new features to ways in which rollup sequencers can decentralize and offer incentives to participants. The Rollups Menu works just like the Stakers Menu:\\\\n\\\\n![rollupsmenu.png](https://bafybeibthhvryza6o6djtofed4ogwv6hqyjiugqanapggogse3fxdvuhz4.ipfs.w3s.link/optimism-menu-60612170996d4b9863d79b0a737bb280.png)\\\\n\\\\nSome other projects we worked on with the resources that the last round we participated in gave us are:\\\\n\\\\n**Staking Brain improvements**: Dappnode\\\\u2019s UI for managing keystores in validators.\\\\n**Ethical Metrics**: a built-in tool for Dappnode that allows node runners to receive e-mail notifications about the status of their Dappnode while preserving their privacy.\", \"website\": \"https://dappnode.com\", \"bannerImg\": \"bafybeigsybupxvmvx7kcubpx75edoiuhbdvxmeiolnm2eepxqk7yx66tfa\", \"logoImg\": \"bafkreibommysn7yhwhl35x76mpgattlvaqq44brl745u6sep2y5ao5tt3e\", \"metaPtr\": {\"protocol\": \"1\", \"pointer\": \"bafkreihqiplejersvvtpl2vitccppcebvvoa3kgu4or2vye6es2m3rhuei\"}, \"userGithub\": \"chuygarcia92\", \"projectGithub\": \"dappnode\", \"projectTwitter\": \"dappnode\", \"credentials\": {\"twitter\": {\"@context\": [\"https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1\"], \"type\": [\"VerifiableCredential\"], \"credentialSubject\": {\"id\": \"did:pkh:eip155:1:0xB22981bA3FE1De2325935c91a3B717168fB86714\", \"@context\": [{\"hash\": \"https://schema.org/Text\", \"provider\": \"https://schema.org/Text\"}], \"provider\": \"ClearTextTwitter#DAppNode\", \"hash\": \"v0.0.0:WYk4IFjxDzUEcHAlabP8x92X+B+0b+fO724RcFa/v+8=\"}, \"issuer\": \"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC\", \"issuanceDate\": \"2023-10-30T18:46:23.751Z\", \"proof\": {\"type\": \"Ed25519Signature2018\", \"proofPurpose\": \"assertionMethod\", \"verificationMethod\": \"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC\", \"created\": \"2023-10-30T18:46:23.751Z\", \"jws\": \"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..qTiDBqniHzcTTtSzZNn61i5nvT5Ga0qg0EQE1CGaPIZfn_CVbHFV8qU5nCIU4l75_f86uB0O3OvT_7M6oFOsCg\"}, \"expirationDate\": \"2024-01-28T18:46:23.751Z\"}, \"github\": {\"@context\": [\"https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1\"], \"type\": [\"VerifiableCredential\"], \"credentialSubject\": {\"id\": \"did:pkh:eip155:1:0xB22981bA3FE1De2325935c91a3B717168fB86714\", \"@context\": [{\"hash\": \"https://schema.org/Text\", \"provider\": \"https://schema.org/Text\"}], \"hash\": \"v0.0.0:3anKgPyP+N/BKjleiyxMY/luXQY18+KTAMQzQVZiYXw=\", \"provider\": \"ClearTextGithubOrg#dappnode#75956027\"}, \"issuer\": \"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC\", \"issuanceDate\": \"2023-10-30T18:46:41.164Z\", \"proof\": {\"type\": \"Ed25519Signature2018\", \"proofPurpose\": \"assertionMethod\", \"verificationMethod\": \"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC\", \"created\": \"2023-10-30T18:46:41.164Z\", \"jws\": \"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..XI_giksyfO01qhT_ZbK6n00fhnFZbtweV6Za4ejKSd_FpnJ1sUFqLOQ3ZlFCLOncsRtPhM0-S-LYPAMB2lgXAg\"}, \"expirationDate\": \"2024-01-28T18:46:41.164Z\"}}}, \"answers\": [{\"questionId\": 0, \"question\": \"Email Address\", \"type\": \"email\", \"hidden\": true, \"encryptedAnswer\": {\"ciphertext\": \"wV1b0nXFv8OXe5kaObRo2b+hslYrm3hX/rsfR0tyJYs=\", \"encryptedSymmetricKey\": \"565bf9d81496a0b5bd937be842cbf7e11833ed7e52fb4ad15abb090f025672bd8ece2ab9a37668dfe0c359abbde47b124ca1dd0b7b2e39a49c3a127183b44ab9fe6093e752c85323b1128af5c3f8eb8be92e95f16f8116b1a096dcf39ab8c989992fcdd0097807cc33b9a8fbd56eb50b2e83305d1a3b637b24c83a09d7eb6ffd000000000000002001111c3dac9168ea8af5baf46f6c67454f3d3a7cea54305ed3b3722f376db4acc718cdda129cebafe8df87b916fcf893\"}}, {\"questionId\": 1, \"question\": \"Project GitHub Repo (Not Team Page)\", \"type\": \"link\", \"hidden\": false, \"answer\": \"https://github.com/dappnode\"}, {\"questionId\": 2, \"question\": \"Telegram Handle (you can answer N/A)\", \"type\": \"short-answer\", \"hidden\": true, \"encryptedAnswer\": {\"ciphertext\": \"AwlKWFGqpk3ucj6Ichgei9CrMFEjWIOD7ClbW6wUYpJfMDIDwZPT/YqkWXJMG/rN\", \"encryptedSymmetricKey\": \"11f83b0e23841667d2df3d261086e43a0bc871104c35c7b16729e3faaa38e35dc2f998eeab8b506382c4e1e02e470f05d8821da14d5a7d02a476bae8f88a99f70bd5ba5ee3b9dc2508fd7e3cecf978a1bcfcb033db65ec6725e4bb26d99990b73b7b69e3d9a32e9f77a1696500e5de954f171094bcbbcda4f4422b3e281193400000000000000020ad1de806c0b9a70b93e4ee83cd675bbca461227b16c094710f3747fee24a0a8a0e02f74d9c44450a9ce851691cf2dba8\"}}, {\"questionId\": 3, \"question\": \"Gitcoin Gov Forum Handle (gov.gitcoin.co)\", \"type\": \"short-answer\", \"hidden\": false, \"answer\": \"@lanski / @chuygarcia.eth\"}, {\"questionId\": 4, \"question\": \"Link to your Public Group Chat (Discord or Telegram )\", \"type\": \"link\", \"hidden\": false, \"answer\": \"https://discord.gg/dappnode\"}, {\"questionId\": 5, \"question\": \"How is your project in support of or directly advancing the Ethereum Network\\\\u2019s infrastructure?

Being confronted with this challenge, a lot of people therefore choose to use a staking service. A understandable choice: if they are in the position of owning 32 ETH, they do not want to risk their funds. But, in turn, this slowly centralizes the network. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### OUR SOLUTION  \\\\n\\\\nOur answer to this problem is STEREUM, our Ethereum node installation, setup & management tool.  \\\\n\\\\nStereum is a toolkit to simplify the process of setting up and maintaining an Ethereum/Gnosis Node. It provides an intuitive GUI to ease the installation process down to a few clicks, lessening the technical entry barrier to a minimum. By reducing complexity, Stereum will therefore attract more individual stakers to the network, promoting Ethererum\\\\u2019s principle of decentralization. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTo use Stereum, you download the launcher and connect remotely to your fresh Ubuntu server. \\\\n\\\\nIn only three clicks Stereum will configure all necessary prerequisites your server has to meet, install and run Ethereum client software, and will ensure that your node is properly connected and synced with the network. \\\\n\\\\nBy setting up your own node with Stereum, you are able to participate in Solo Staking in your prefered network and validate transactions and blocks. Your node also serves as your gateway to the network for data science, dApp usage and development. \\\\n\\\\nAs Stereum aims to be the most flexible way to leverage your node for ETH staking, you also have the opportunity to run different node related protocols (like SSV, etc.) and profit of their unique architecture. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### \\\\ufeffUSE OF FUNDS  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\ufeffYour contribution is greatly appreciated by the team and will be used in various ways \\\\u2013 development, testing and security audits. We spend the funds generated through grants and donations purely on tasks that will benefit the progress of the project and therefore the decentralization of Ethereum as well as the protocols on it. \\\\n\\\\n### FURTHER LINKS\\\\n\\\\n- \\\\ud83c\\\\udf44\\\\ufeff Project Website - https://stereum.net/\\\\n- \\\\ud83d\\\\udd28\\\\ufeff GitHub - https://github.com/stereum-dev/ethereum-node\\\\n- \\\\ud83d\\\\udcac\\\\ufeff Discord - https://discord.gg/DzAwgnSXtB\\\\n- \\\\ud83d\\\\udcf0\\\\ufeff Twitter - https://twitter.com/stereumdev\\\\n- \\\\ud83d\\\\udcfa\\\\ufeff YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/@Stereum\", \"website\": \"https://stereum.net\", \"bannerImg\": \"bafkreie4jnbuiu3gx75pxpp3vlffpflfixsv25i4s6ckhq2k3k5lthjuzq\", \"logoImg\": \"bafkreiejifxxruoky56lgsentptmvt5bugftfv2zqrdvjhzxccyafty5au\", \"metaPtr\": {\"protocol\": \"1\", \"pointer\": \"bafkreibneolzxzim2y34j53pisij2hxn6gjebot4s6ecfq2aonipsigimy\"}, \"userGithub\": \"stefa2k\", \"projectGithub\": \"stereum-dev\", \"projectTwitter\": \"stereumdev\", \"credentials\": {\"twitter\": {\"@context\": [\"https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1\"], \"type\": [\"VerifiableCredential\"], \"credentialSubject\": {\"id\": \"did:pkh:eip155:1:0x6E41fe2F8303b89c9dbcCABE59A7F7f8F4312cA9\", \"hash\": \"v0.0.0:3Z4WYB8fzEDozu1Fl2fv1Y4DdM50uQ0syc2zoXtQ+To=\", \"provider\": \"ClearTextTwitter#stereumdev\", \"@context\": [{\"hash\": \"https://schema.org/Text\", \"provider\": \"https://schema.org/Text\"}]}, \"issuer\": \"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC\", \"issuanceDate\": \"2023-11-09T19:31:53.528Z\", \"proof\": {\"type\": \"Ed25519Signature2018\", \"proofPurpose\": \"assertionMethod\", \"verificationMethod\": \"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC\", \"created\": \"2023-11-09T19:31:53.528Z\", \"jws\": \"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..TxT3CsPCxq6Y84Z0cby0hcV2TZmcbRcgNjVuM9e6yiIG6pcgHe3E7K-qHnFpM9_ssVeaNX-q72LXgIpTG_eRDQ\"}, \"expirationDate\": \"2024-02-07T19:31:53.528Z\"}, \"github\": {\"@context\": [\"https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1\"], \"type\": [\"VerifiableCredential\"], \"credentialSubject\": {\"id\": \"did:pkh:eip155:1:0x6E41fe2F8303b89c9dbcCABE59A7F7f8F4312cA9\", \"provider\": \"ClearTextGithubOrg#stereum-dev#54934211\", \"@context\": [{\"hash\": \"https://schema.org/Text\", \"provider\": \"https://schema.org/Text\"}], \"hash\": \"v0.0.0:sIF2FxVDf4e5X96xso7PSOZ5UtfDXG066XVi3VwSdJI=\"}, \"issuer\": \"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC\", \"issuanceDate\": \"2023-11-09T19:32:33.283Z\", \"proof\": {\"type\": \"Ed25519Signature2018\", \"proofPurpose\": \"assertionMethod\", \"verificationMethod\": \"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC\", \"created\": \"2023-11-09T19:32:33.283Z\", \"jws\": \"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..nFk72AAYBs8myyvzRlXJlvPW1xwElThN8bEZv7wX_gsFJ3Tj-Y88TY_1zqtDhxKKc4MTSD4hS0GdMPz6VrHLBg\"}, \"expirationDate\": \"2024-02-07T19:32:33.283Z\"}}}, \"answers\": [{\"questionId\": 0, \"question\": \"Email Address\", \"type\": \"email\", \"hidden\": true, \"encryptedAnswer\": {\"ciphertext\": \"2zIXJ0DB82H201YL7X4F9btbooHwyExkIv6dy9WCkfAgr80w3VzScW6GPqeb/JFw\", \"encryptedSymmetricKey\": \"44e1c29e13bd9c1eb083c38d45e6013833259ecd4a53a24a58dfcae6b698e5f6c7aaaa1515a1a04ca8125eeb91e0880996f047bb414a4936af3be76f6063b266f3112466bc273928e0e411362cf393fe759d14d6e563efc62adf917e28a203b76e212ba5e4e452a8a770fe4aa8423a58408d2738f2ab538462704d54cfc74733000000000000002045e68cd314acff3d9fd972dde503f3ab6961ec42002628e8645e4298755c77c9b63f20cb8155f38492514774093ba3ac\"}}, {\"questionId\": 1, \"question\": \"Project GitHub Repo (Not Team Page)\", \"type\": \"link\", \"hidden\": false, \"answer\": \"https://github.com/stereum-dev/ethereum-node\"}, {\"questionId\": 2, \"question\": \"Telegram Handle (you can answer N/A)\", \"type\": \"short-answer\", \"hidden\": true, \"encryptedAnswer\": {\"ciphertext\": \"TkuWDZJo6KTpMTvtx5tDcQVHGgl6cRoLnCEZ69akhWc=\", \"encryptedSymmetricKey\": \"ce226a693e017ddc4b189404e0d821fd9c6f8dd3d12418a70eb9b67775028e6744225369f488a85e554386efc4c6e80be1f6e0df2c7604b409972a5594129db3b881895c6fe11ce2a664d5a5c16417d1bd431269a350ef5907f923a6eb6fc683e4f66e4d51bf9ecdedea033b12be6fc1ad07d55e9758e73b3aabb9ad734acfdb000000000000002023e616af11091000b921f2fa0fd47be45c2c16ce9738db003678e8b0e37166bc145153c846c458391d2d470d455748b2\"}}, {\"questionId\": 3, \"question\": \"Gitcoin Gov Forum Handle (gov.gitcoin.co)\", \"type\": \"short-answer\", \"hidden\": false}, {\"questionId\": 4, \"question\": \"Link to your Public Group Chat (Discord or Telegram )\", \"type\": \"link\", \"hidden\": false, \"answer\": \"https://discord.gg/8Znj8K6GjN\"}, {\"questionId\": 5, \"question\": \"How is your project in support of or directly advancing the Ethereum Network\\\\u2019s infrastructure?

Developing this cryptographic primitive, or PLUMEs, into wallets, will unlock sybil-resistant anonymous apps like zk nullifiers for anonymous unlinked airdrops, anonymous decentralized voting which only allows one vote per account, anonymous proof of solvency, and message boards with a consistent identity. We think that fully executing this work will create a whole new class of dapps and web3 social apps with pseudonymity.\\\\n\\\\nThis anonymous identity is henceforth called your PLUME -- a privately linked unique message entity. In other words, we will deploy verifiably deterministic signatures on Ethereum.\\\\n\\\\nThis grant will go to helping to integrate a new, non-interactive signature scheme into wallets such as Metamask, implementing ERC 7524 in more wallets, and engineering faster and faster zero knowledge cryptography behind it. Note that this scheme offers an improvement to semaphore or tornado cash nullifiers, because the first few people who sign up will not have small anonymity sets. The grant will also help to publish the paper that proves the security of the scheme via a DDH-VRF argument, and pay for conference expenses so it can be presented more widely. It will be split amongst Kobi, Aayush, Richard, Piotr, and future grants for future work to anyone else who would like to help productionize this work!\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\'d like to read the paper, it can be found at https://aayushg.com/thesis.pdf. The slides to fully explain the new scheme are found here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mKtOI4XgKrWBEPpKFAYkRjxZsBomwhy6Cc2Ia87hAnY, and the code is here: https://github.com/zk-nullifier-sig/zk-nullifier-sig. The academic paper is here: https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1255. A blog post is here: https://blog.aayushg.com/posts/nullifier. DM @yush_g on Twitter with questions, or anywhere in the EF PSE Discord! Initial research was funded by a $4k grant from 0xPARC and done as part of an MIT masters thesis.\\\\n\\\\nWANT TO HELP? We are looking for help to integrate this scheme into more wallets, help finish the halo2 version, as well as redo stealthdrop.xyz to work with this scheme. If you\\'re excited about being a major part of the future of Ethereum and creating novel primitives like private voting, private airdrops, proof of solvency, or message boards with reputation, please reach out to @yush_g on Telegram or Twitter! We have grants out from this Gitcoin Grant pool available to help people -- especially hash to curve in halo2.\\\\n\\\\nOCTOBER 2023 UPDATE: Your money has gone to good use! A number of open source contributors have picked up bounties and resolved over half of the outstanding issues. Grants funded by you helped get a PR out to Taho Wallet (by Oren Yomtov) to integrate PLUME, and have a Ledger C implementation (by PSE) finished for which we are waiting on both an audit and review by their team. We also have a grant in progress with Aztec to get PLUME into Noir to be a note type on their network, and Mina published work regarding PLUMEs in their system as well. While we got a grant to integrate into Metamask Snaps, a recent change actually made that impossible. We also published ERC 7524 for PLUME to give teams a universal standard :)\\\\n\\\\nAPRIL 2023 UPDATE: Your money has gone to good use! Due to your generosity, we were able to push forward a lot of progress, including that we were able to develop a Metamask snap (deployed at nullifier.xyz) and push an independent Javascript implementation that discovered an overflow bug in both of the Rust implementations! We also released a circom version, and received a V2 proposal from Poseidon. We also started working on a Ledger implementation with two new teammates (as of April 2023). We also are building towards an ERC/EIP as well as early bugfixes and a V3 proposal with a smaller hash to curve circuit, both of which we are actively polishing drafts on in collaboration with EF PSE and hope to have published once the halo2 proof is done.\\\\n\\\\nA V2 proposal was submitted by Poseidon/Manta in Q1 2023: https://www.notion.so/mantanetwork/PLUME-Discussion-6f4b7e7cf63e4e33976f6e697bf349ff?pvs=4 which we have already built into the original repository and ERC!\", \"website\": \"https://github.com/plume-sig\", \"bannerImg\": \"bafkreihqxqp3et3emr2d6r6rnhtdv5j4l25n4r7pcpncfwkhb6s4uxg62y\", \"logoImg\": \"bafkreiedtzft3kecwvr5fdlipwvmeqhobxpvo6a2ylrdgxjsnjk3swowvy\", \"metaPtr\": {\"protocol\": \"1\", \"pointer\": \"bafkreiddr3ywi2d6u2pkwbk756wpnnfu5xv6py2w4m7lrcvb2x4vo7imlq\"}, \"userGithub\": \"Divide-By-0\", \"projectGithub\": \"plume-sig\", \"projectTwitter\": \"yush_g\", \"credentials\": {\"github\": {\"@context\": [\"https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1\"], \"type\": [\"VerifiableCredential\"], \"credentialSubject\": {\"id\": \"did:pkh:eip155:1:0x23aDa6E6A9E9D4EcDDd185e3ec353163BCeeBF2a\", \"@context\": [{\"hash\": \"https://schema.org/Text\", \"provider\": \"https://schema.org/Text\"}], \"provider\": \"ClearTextGithubOrg#plume-sig#4804438\", \"hash\": \"v0.0.0:5JGFzF46iW+ixMF2omzENPESr+iKATWHorF8ohNlUno=\"}, \"issuer\": \"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC\", \"issuanceDate\": \"2023-11-15T00:57:40.781Z\", \"proof\": {\"type\": \"Ed25519Signature2018\", \"proofPurpose\": \"assertionMethod\", \"verificationMethod\": \"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC\", \"created\": \"2023-11-15T00:57:40.781Z\", \"jws\": \"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..9XWJN_sxL31syGWkNZYiS4UKNkqh386010bqUU4qMfCAolAE97cSH3-zr5dnJEqwnAYCI8mPWrtAijxIlyZADg\"}, \"expirationDate\": \"2024-02-13T00:57:40.781Z\"}, \"twitter\": {\"@context\": [\"https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1\"], \"type\": [\"VerifiableCredential\"], \"credentialSubject\": {\"id\": \"did:pkh:eip155:1:0x23aDa6E6A9E9D4EcDDd185e3ec353163BCeeBF2a\", \"provider\": \"ClearTextTwitter#yush_g\", \"hash\": \"v0.0.0:Vv6A8RcHCu/MuoZ+9BaIwLhStRqnZykSkpgZnL/FQPc=\", \"@context\": [{\"hash\": \"https://schema.org/Text\", \"provider\": \"https://schema.org/Text\"}]}, \"issuer\": \"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC\", \"issuanceDate\": \"2023-10-31T17:24:54.164Z\", \"proof\": {\"type\": \"Ed25519Signature2018\", \"proofPurpose\": \"assertionMethod\", \"verificationMethod\": \"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC\", \"created\": \"2023-10-31T17:24:54.164Z\", \"jws\": \"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..91Nkl-q2ZpPXFxeBWuIX_5fYGBDnqhg2YY2s4zN7CIee3jHydUnJIn39XmoF0Og4jdgMNtbUj9Kl5cNaNgksBQ\"}, \"expirationDate\": \"2024-01-29T17:24:54.164Z\"}}}, \"answers\": [{\"questionId\": 0, \"question\": \"Email Address\", \"type\": \"email\", \"hidden\": true, \"encryptedAnswer\": {\"ciphertext\": \"KL3OK4h/v8+OBvX5OkFXj1ln68eYPNLt1+4pbQFt96Y=\", \"encryptedSymmetricKey\": \"e34ee8ebcd53cf0955d7c164d8ccfbdfbd8af7a68230501044da7823ffb38488fbdbfb0e68e181fd1504d16d2e02db0182af30df54a059143885ffbbff3a4b8129d1db08bc233efef1a4417244dacc065243ddfe0926ec9433cb7682b504a1ab1e2f93497ce74ee6a73c4d441878020e38d5881275220582ef8fb7e83227b43d0000000000000020ab4040e96deaeb405e05d93f164a2768f0ca78abfa39c9f52dd7aed5b2f16d6c6bd021b7c3e7e3905232cf84d451c8b1\"}}, {\"questionId\": 1, \"question\": \"Project GitHub Repo (Not Team Page)\", \"type\": \"link\", \"hidden\": false, \"answer\": \"https://github.com/plume-sig\"}, {\"questionId\": 2, \"question\": \"Telegram Handle (you can answer N/A)\", \"type\": \"short-answer\", \"hidden\": true, \"encryptedAnswer\": {\"ciphertext\": \"upcTvwNEqtYguW91vI60tsq3DlyFOhRsrxhG661fKQA=\", \"encryptedSymmetricKey\": \"9229c9ae252e1ed29e519edb74b7f6d24d79540718b6bf084808c8a61cfc530b35de8e06724ef326983b89e54eefa607d1ad75c29ea6de3ba17c6769a9610425b0a225f07331e5a94bab5e00e3457cc3fcb99d05f8d04acdbf2df25fef2ccc821eaa34cd9c27e921df6a1adeba52b1b5aff559a8a4e77069f6337d8c41c6f54b0000000000000020ba7e850ebece96e11ea5035c6a48c93bfc76a33b66c58f286fa96c0a59bb7454c314129a17d406b6f7f9ae6c1f3c218d\"}}, {\"questionId\": 3, \"question\": \"Gitcoin Gov Forum Handle (gov.gitcoin.co)\", \"type\": \"short-answer\", \"hidden\": false}, {\"questionId\": 4, \"question\": \"Link to your Public Group Chat (Discord or Telegram )\", \"type\": \"link\", \"hidden\": false}, {\"questionId\": 5, \"question\": \"How is your project in support of or directly advancing the Ethereum Network\\\\u2019s infrastructure? \", \"type\": \"paragraph\", \"hidden\": false, \"answer\": \"Verifiably deterministic signatures on Ethereum make it possible to have a unique, anonymous identity.

This is useful for provenant proofs of identity like proof of twitter account, github contribution, and anonymous KYC -- all of which have open source prototypes now, without centralized attesters (see prove.email for links). Our code, roadmap, and ideas are fully open source at https://github.com/zkemail.\\\\n\\\\nWe are also building the Email Wallet (demo: https://emailwallet.org, docs: http://docs.emailwallet.org) as an open standard and protocol that anyone can plug into -- it allows you to use your email as a wallet signer, allowing much easier onboarding onto Ethereum. In addition, plaintext emails serve as a one-click replacement for wallets for signing and sending transactions.\\\\n\\\\nWe rely only on pre-existing cryptography and our bespoke, highly optimized ZK proofs to verify your mailserver\\'s signatures -- there is no centralized computation. No MPC assumptions. No trusted hardware. No trusted attestation servers. Only trust smart contracts, email, and DNS infrastructure.\\\\n\\\\nWe think this is the future of provenant identity proofs on Ethereum, as well as the future of simple wallet interfaces to onboard new people to crypto. \\\\n\\\\nMoney will go towards hiring developers to contribute, travel expenses for folks working on the project, and funding hackathon prizes to encourage folks to build atop the protocol.\\\\n\\\\nThe work is entirely open source. Previous work has led to a number of impactful open source contributions in the zk space including:\\\\n- The first RSA-SHA256 circuit in halo2\\\\n- The first ZK Regex circuits and libraries, in circom and halo2\\\\n- Halo2 Benchmarking: We have open sourced a halo2 wasm benchmarking repo that runs any halo2 wasm code in the browser on 100 instances in parallel for any browser on any operating system (mobile or desktop), and spits out the mean running time and variance -- we intend to publish this as an easy to use Cargo and NPM package soon for others to use.\\\\n- Halo2 Optimizations: We have various halo2 circuits to split verifiers, divide circuits for faster parallel client side proving, and many others. We have in addition contributed back to  various open source libraries in the ecosystem.\\\\n- Educational content: We have curated a set of blog posts, talks, and docs around our experiences, including generic ZK breakdowns and explainers such as https://prove.email/blog/zk.\\\\n- Circom Hash to Curve on the Grumpkin Curve: Our circuits enable proving the private set intersection (PSI) protocol in ZK, which we use for decentralized relayer communication, so that relayers cannot censor unfavorable queries.\", \"website\": \"https://prove.email\", \"bannerImg\": \"bafkreicumln6pna2hxluq3rsxadwwk6jzdcenam5jtqqn4wmxwkzriodku\", \"logoImg\": \"bafkreia4k2wuytbaw2jxvirdhaivkhwy6eo77lvtrn3ynvg7lsflcti4cu\", \"metaPtr\": {\"protocol\": \"1\", \"pointer\": \"bafkreia2ug7u72t6fykxmlqdbvdiygz6yncbeso27ogzknkj4xql73ferq\"}, \"userGithub\": \"Divide-By-0\", \"projectGithub\": \"zkemail\", \"projectTwitter\": \"proofofemail\", \"credentials\": {\"twitter\": {\"@context\": [\"https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1\"], \"type\": [\"VerifiableCredential\"], \"credentialSubject\": {\"id\": \"did:pkh:eip155:1:0x6171aeBcC9e9B9E1D90EC9C2E124982932297345\", \"hash\": \"v0.0.0:235/91DZr8+Zz94P4h/jAj4dOuDG0+Eb5FayiYuYK7g=\", \"@context\": [{\"hash\": \"https://schema.org/Text\", \"provider\": \"https://schema.org/Text\"}], \"provider\": \"ClearTextTwitter#proofofemail\"}, \"issuer\": \"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC\", \"issuanceDate\": \"2023-08-29T05:38:15.978Z\", \"proof\": {\"type\": \"Ed25519Signature2018\", \"proofPurpose\": \"assertionMethod\", \"verificationMethod\": \"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC\", \"created\": \"2023-08-29T05:38:15.978Z\", \"jws\": \"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..Kv0M6kPRo4lOVCeh2xFDmFVNINgF5st1y15C9MYwXg9bT7v8nmbTDfWkBhGciJqPJy9Ei4EQWwl4HJ6iQHVJBA\"}, \"expirationDate\": \"2023-11-27T05:38:15.978Z\"}, \"github\": {\"@context\": [\"https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1\"], \"type\": [\"VerifiableCredential\"], \"credentialSubject\": {\"id\": \"did:pkh:eip155:1:0x6171aeBcC9e9B9E1D90EC9C2E124982932297345\", \"@context\": [{\"hash\": \"https://schema.org/Text\", \"provider\": \"https://schema.org/Text\"}], \"provider\": \"ClearTextGithubOrg#zkemail#4804438\", \"hash\": \"v0.0.0:N2WNxQDjqw4fbgxVgl21OqFvIJuDaVRm+0AIhtPv80c=\"}, \"issuer\": \"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC\", \"issuanceDate\": \"2023-08-29T05:38:25.704Z\", \"proof\": {\"type\": \"Ed25519Signature2018\", \"proofPurpose\": \"assertionMethod\", \"verificationMethod\": \"did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC\", \"created\": \"2023-08-29T05:38:25.704Z\", \"jws\": \"eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..UTHrDzIE5hmJ9dMeZ6W_Ye8ku2AuuXJKktJ_06A01biJbFywzQyKFs863lCjEVqq__kXJCzFtI5LfK1mcfj6Aw\"}, \"expirationDate\": \"2023-11-27T05:38:25.704Z\"}}}, \"answers\": [{\"questionId\": 0, \"question\": \"Email Address\", \"type\": \"email\", \"hidden\": true, \"encryptedAnswer\": {\"ciphertext\": \"d09COPy9y9CXPnIxPBoaf3obKkH4JhljvlVBGRwm1j/PDTJHHWLFfaegoJkeZNPV\", \"encryptedSymmetricKey\": \"4f215db501696c59de9f61d47008640491693eb49313c82efe58b09d653f01ab7abff7dcef87697cd9cb2088ebbee312b51f3659535ec4a6139da63bfbc91333c78a0f914c1f4c660eaaf2a483faa9bce010f1215ac2403f607807c30c4fb2a2a16ec79820b22579550bdfa452c0d1887bea5681491eb5b9848a7030028bb4c7000000000000002083401081ff152aa83591d7955cdf9b3a6da71002786a3b0011820caab6e4f905c24245eb43b3024c1d5b696ebb665483\"}}, {\"questionId\": 1, \"question\": \"Project GitHub Repo (Not Team Page)\", \"type\": \"link\", \"hidden\": false, \"answer\": \"https://github.com/zkemail\"}, {\"questionId\": 2, \"question\": \"Telegram Handle (you can answer N/A)\", \"type\": \"short-answer\", \"hidden\": true, \"encryptedAnswer\": {\"ciphertext\": \"v3bPiuZtNUs6OgB/JZogkEvXwsZYXhOnDX4yyJQbnsI=\", \"encryptedSymmetricKey\": \"62df8e286b112d2ec657269d34076186dd6bd110738b720f0dd3ea6dd61f1ae7a28d3bf1eb1ef4609db9d5cfd01c55059b5388299236f825a2a20b1cf61d8230bd31011b0a0dfb1286f274ff28abd19aa8226a28e77ed5250cb4c3ed7a9aab961890d9672ad7bc8f37ce57132bed47d8068927f5724a7d7f946c25c6012ad9b50000000000000020407ad69a220ff08353d3161762dd861458e137361be01628bab7998eb83dfc0a056e7541be6bf88a5f601d077f8c18a7\"}}, {\"questionId\": 3, \"question\": \"Gitcoin Gov Forum Handle (gov.gitcoin.co)\", \"type\": \"short-answer\", \"hidden\": false}, {\"questionId\": 4, \"question\": \"Link to your Public Group Chat (Discord or Telegram )\", \"type\": \"link\", \"hidden\": false, \"answer\": \"https://t.me/zkemail\"}, {\"questionId\": 5, \"question\": \"How is your project in support of or directly advancing the Ethereum Network\\\\u2019s infrastructure?

[\\\\ud83d\\\\ude02\\\\ud83d\\\\ude02\\\\ud83d\\\\ude02.eth.limo](https://xn--g28haa.eth.limo/)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2611\\\\ufe0fOur new proxy supports fallback record checking. No content hash defined? No problem! Anyone with an @ensdomains can simply amend .limo in their browser to resolve a personalized Nimi profile. This pulls your ENS avatar, text records and even displays poaps! Users with an ENS name can effortlessly obtain a social landing page with no technical knowledge required. Give it a try!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2611\\\\ufe0f Limo now supports on-demand @ensdomains subdomain certificates!\\\\nWhat does this mean? You can now automatically issue a certificate for ENS subdomains without requesting one from us! \\\\nHow does this work? Once you submit an HTTP request for your name (i.e. app.myname.eth. limo), we\\'ll attempt to issue the certificate in the background. Usually this process takes 1-2m and during that time you might need to keep refreshing the page in your browser. Once the certificate has been issued you\\'ll be able to visit your subdomain on eth.limo.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2611\\\\ufe0fDNS over HTTPS (DoH) Resolver DNS over HTTPS (DoH) resolver. We now offer an easy to use DNS resolver for ENS domains. The DoH resolver can be integrated with applications for native ENS resolution, or even your browser! We feature both JSON and DNS wire format responses with DNSLink support. This means you can configure your local IPFS client to resolve ENS domains directly from us with the following command:\\\\n`ipfs config --json DNS.Resolvers \\'{\\\\\"eth.\\\\\": \\\\\"https://dns.eth.limo/dns-query\\\\\"}\\'`\\\\nFor example if you then requested vitalik.eth, a DNS query would be constructed (https://dns.eth.limo/dns-query?name=vitalik.eth&type=TXT) which would return:\\\\n>dnslink=/ipfs/QmQhCuJqSk9fF58wU58oiaJ1qbZwQ1eQ8mVzNWe7tgLNiD/\\\\nWhich would instruct your IPFS client to retrieve the CID above. Consult our documentation for implementation details.\\\\n[Documentation](https://github.com/ethlimo/documentation)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2611\\\\ufe0f Chauffeur - Run a local infrastructure stack for resolving ENS domains.  https://github.com/ethlimo/chauffeur\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2611\\\\ufe0fHTTP Object Caching - Improving content retrieval times is always a priority for the eth.limo team. After several weeks of careful testing we have fully implemented static content object caching, globally for all eth.limo resolved names. This means that we will cache content retrieved from IPFS and save it for later retrieval. The result being much faster page load times for all static content.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2611\\\\ufe0fBase32 and Base36 Encoding for IPFS/IPNS - We have updated both the eth.limo gateway and our DNS over HTTPS service to explicitly use Base32 encoding for IPFS CIDs and Base36 for IPNS peer IDs.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2611\\\\ufe0fLIMO takes public gateway services a step further by enforcing strong privacy guarantees such as never logging IP addresses or engaging in TCP fingerprinting. Limo now actively blocks FLoC (Federated Learning of Cohorts). This is a Google developed algorithm that tracks and correlates users based on their browsing history. FLoC enables advanced fingerprinting capabilities and greatly undermines online privacy and anonymity.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ud83d\\\\udee0We\\\\u2019re excited to announce that we have begun work on limo-web3-dns, an experimental\\\\ndomain specific implementation of the DNS protocol for direct resolution of ENS records.\\\\n\\\\nThe limo-web3-dns nameserver will extend traditional DNS functionality to on-chain\\\\nENS domain records, allowing native and seamless resolution via most network\\\\ncapable clients. The ultimate goal of limo-web3-dns is to provide trustless, auditable,\\\\nand cryptographically signed ENS over DNS to bring ENS to parity with DNS.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMore information can be found here -\\\\nhttps://ethlimo.substack.com/p/8fd72f82-509c-4a0e-9d40-e7dc41a368a0\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u26ab\\\\ufe0f Road Map\\\\nLIMO has an ambitious road-map, aimed at bolstering accessibility and facilitating developer experience with a suite of modern deployment tools.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ud83d\\\\udd35Hotcaching - Caching is a big component of the eth.limo architecture and we are always looking for ways to improve it. In its current form, our caching layer will store ENS domain & contenthash pair mappings with a 15m TTL. This is obviously less than desirable as newly deployed content will not be visible to users immediately. In order to alleviate this limitation, we have been working on a \\\\u201chotcache\\\\u201d solution that will dynamically update our ENS mapping cache in real-time as records are updated on-chain. Initial support will be limited to names using the ENS public resolver. Record updates will be synchronized as they happen, making updated content available in a timely fashion.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ud83d\\\\udd35Reverse Lookups -  Ever wondered if a particular IPFS CID is associated with an ENS name? Immediately following deployment of the Hotcache, we will begin working on a reverse lookup API for ENS domains. This means that you can search for ENS names based on the IPFS CID or contenthash.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ud83d\\\\udd35Research on HTTP Header Standards for ENS dWebsites.\\\\nHTTP headers are tricky to get right, even more so in decentralized environments. Certain browser features (like SharedArrayBuffer) can only be used in a \\\\u201cSame-Origin\\\\u201d context, which requires the use of certain server side headers to be returned to the client. With this in mind, we are investigating the best way for users to define their own header and value pairs at the ENS record level. This would be a new standard for ENS HTTP gateways and permit users to fully leverage all available browser features irrespective of how the content is accessed (i.e. gateway or web3 native browsers).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ud83d\\\\udd35Privacy first traffic analysis and reporting - view how many requests your ENS dwebsite has received\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ud83d\\\\udd35Deployment tooling - Choose which versions of content you want to serve prior to going \\\\u201call in\\\\u201d on an IPFS release.

Accessing the dWeb can be a frustrating experience. For dApp developers, this leads to a limited selection of platforms and services in addition to lost revenue.\\\\n\\\\nThe LIMO project brings additional resiliency to dApps by providing an alternative means of access as a public good. As the decentralized web continues to grow, it is imperative that community projects facilitate the transition from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0.\\\\n\\\\nThe LIMO project is organized around the following founding principles:\\\\n\\\\n1. Operate ETH.LIMO as a public good.\\\\n\\\\n2. Establish community governance and oversight.\\\\n\\\\na. Provide support and technical guidance for builders and users.\\\\n\\\\n3. Work towards building a truly decentralized ENS/IPFS gateway service and global CDN.\\\\n\\\\n4. Build a world-class developer platform for dweb sites, including integrated analytics reporting and traffic management deployment tooling for commonly used web2 patterns such as A/B testing, canary and blue/green deployments.\\\\n\\\\n5.
